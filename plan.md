# Stock Analysis GNN Machine Learning Workflow - Detailed Project Plan

## Project Overview
Develop a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based stock analysis system to identify causal relationships between stocks and predict how one stock influences others' price movements N days ahead. The system will establish strong/weak connection relationships between stocks using advanced GNN models like GCN and GraphSAGE.

## Core Objectives
- Analyze causal relationships and mutual influences between stocks
- Predict Stock A's impact on Stock B's decline N days ahead
- Build dynamic stock relationship graphs with strength indicators
- Implement GCN and GraphSAGE models for temporal prediction
- Quantify influence propagation through stock networks
- Support periodic model updates with inductive and transductive learning
- Enable short-term updates for new stocks and key events
- Provide long-term comprehensive model retraining capabilities
- Design modular, replaceable model architecture for easy swapping
- Implement plugin-based system for extending model capabilities
